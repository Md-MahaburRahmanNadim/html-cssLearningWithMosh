  <!-- video from pexcls website -->
  <!-- what is mean by controls and autoplay and loop
  A Boolean attribute; if specified, the video automatically begins to play back as soon as it can do so without stopping to finish loading the data.

  someone think that they can specifi the value true or false like programing language but it's not applicable here. If those keyword appaire the browser trit as a true value if is not there then is treat as false that's it
  -->
  <video controls autoplay loop src="videos/occen.mp4">Alt text: your browser don't support video </video>
  <!-- <audio src=""></audio> semilear video 
  

    but different is that if the video is bigger then the screen and create a horizontal var then we have to specified the width and height of the video for simplear canculation of the browser
